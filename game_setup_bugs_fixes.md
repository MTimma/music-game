# Game Setup Bugs - Fixes Implemented

## Summary of Fixes

### ✅ Bug #1: Non-host players not seeing their added songs
**Fix:** Updated `Lobby.tsx` to show `MySongs` component for all players instead of just non-host players.
- **Changed:** `{!isHost && (<MySongs ... />)}` → `<MySongs ... />`
- **Result:** All players can now see their added songs and count

### ✅ Bug #2: Host determined by URL parameter instead of Spotify session  
**Fix:** Modified host detection logic to use lobby data instead of URL parameters.
- **Changed in `Lobby.tsx`:** 
  - Removed `const isHost = searchParams.get('host') === 'true'`
  - Added state-based host detection from lobby player data
  - Host status now determined by `player.isHost` field in Firestore
- **Changed in `CreateLobby.tsx`:** Removed `?host=true` from navigation URL
- **Result:** Host privileges now based on actual lobby ownership, not manipulatable URL

### ✅ Bug #3: Ready button CSS becomes very large after clicking
**Fix:** Added `max-width` constraints to prevent button expansion.
- **Changed in `ReadyButton.css`:**
  - Added `max-width: 200px` to `.ready-button`
  - Added `max-width: 150px` for mobile breakpoint
- **Result:** Button maintains consistent size after state changes

### ✅ Bug #4: Error page appears briefly after Spotify authentication
**Fix:** Simplified the callback handling to prevent redirect loops.
- **Changed in `SpotifyCallback.tsx`:**
  - Removed redundant API call that was causing the error
  - Now checks auth status directly and shows success message
  - Faster redirect with better user feedback
- **Result:** Smoother authentication flow without error flash

### ✅ Bug #5: Start match button enabled after players become unready
**Fix:** Updated start game logic to check player readiness.
- **Changed in `PlaylistStats.tsx`:**
  - Added `allPlayersReady` prop to component interface
  - Updated `canStartGame()` to include readiness check
  - Enhanced status message to indicate readiness requirement
- **Changed in `Lobby.tsx`:** Pass `getAllPlayersReady()` to PlaylistStats
- **Result:** Start game button properly disabled when any player becomes unready

## Additional Improvements
- Updated test files to reflect URL parameter removal
- Enhanced status messages to be more informative about requirements
