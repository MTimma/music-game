todo for Lobby.tsx
1. Players do not see their added songs. After adding song, MySongs.tsx is not updated/populated.

2. Host does not have MySongs.tsx component. Also, host should see which players are not ready - list of all players


3. host page is rendered by ?host=true parameter gives control to the game lobby. It should be inferred from host Spotify user session instead of URL flag which can be set by users.

4. mark as ready button has odd css - becomes very large after clicking

5. after host authenticating in Spotify - there is a red page for callback, showing:
Authentication Error

Missing code parameter

Redirecting to home page...
 but after redirect the user is logged in successfully


6. After clicking ready - and then unready - start match button is still enabled

7. Player already in lobby

Once the 401 loop begins the React component keeps polling every second. After 100 requests in 15 minutes the global rate-limiter you set with express-rate-limit replies 429. Fixing the token storage will stop the 401s and the 429s disappear.
Next steps you might take
Patch the front-end as above and test one full game start to verify the field appears in Firestore and /currently-playing/â€¦ returns JSON.
Consider debouncing or back-off in the polling hook (e.g., stop polling for 30 s after a 401) to avoid hammering the server if a future auth error occurs.
Log an explicit warning in the front-end when the first 401 arrives so the host knows they need to re-link Spotify.
