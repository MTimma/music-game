I read recommendations about such workflow, where we plan everything before writing any code:

"Well, there's a lot of planning and architecture before there's any building. Several pages of user flows and notes. Then I break it down into milestones and sprints. For each sprint I break it down into steps. Then we go through an iterative process of ensuring the architecture is well defined and add any cautionary advise.
Determine which stack, libraries, design patterns we're going to use and develop schemas, etc. I find using a design like DDD to be super helpful. Then when I'm satisfied and 03 can't find meaningful improvements for the MVP, I have it build out step by steps for each sprint and todos for each milestone. Then I move the relevant docs to cursor rules to be called for every new chat. Make sure the docs reference each other. Each new sprint is a new chat. Just call up the doc for the sprint you're on and walk it through it.

This is the way. I spent days preparing linked markdown documentation. I also make 500 lines limit to optimize context. Great results!

You can split the docs and reference each other. It only calls them up if needed for reference. I also add a few notes about what the other files contain with my references.

Yes, documents in a folder and linked through an ÍNDEX.md file so agent consumes only What is related to task and not waste context and all docs Max 500 lines. If section is larger, split.

I created a linked matrix and file architecture with an archived sibling folder for observational references just in case. Each Claude session is it's own spring and it has a delivery template. Then we recursively go back and more granularly and architecturally revisit our code, prune etc

How that works? I Will look into that.
Thanks for the reference"


 I would like to implement following features in my project. Do not write any code. Lets plan out sprints and workflows for each feature. Lets start with first one.

Create some initial plan and I will add to it.

1. Create game lobby and invite anonymous players - friends
2. Add songs to a shared playlist
3. Guess which player added each song
4. Real-time score tracking
5. Spotify integration for music playback (not necessary as written, main necessity is to see which song is currently played from playlist by user)

Feature #1 — “Create game lobby and invite anonymous players”

Below is an initial, high-level delivery plan.  Think of it as a living outline: you can add or re-sequence work as the vision evolves.  Nothing here is code; it is the structure of the work.

────────────────────────────────────
A. Architecture & Tech Decisions
────────────────────────────────────
1. Domain‐Driven “feature slice”  
   • Bounded Context: Lobby  
   • Core Aggregates/Entities  
     - GameLobby (root)  
     - Player (value object until registration)  
     - InviteToken (value object, short-lived)  

2. Persistence & Real-time transports  
   • Firebase Realtime DB for initial MVP (easy websockets, generous free tier)  
   • Firestore rules for auth/ACL; anonymous Firebase Auth for guests  
   • Use Firestore/Realtime “onWrite” functions later for side effects (scoreboard)  

3. Front-end patterns  
   • React + Context / Zustand for lobby state  
   • React-Router route “/lobby/:lobbyId” (host & guests)  
   • URL sharing instead of e-mail (simpler, no mail service early)  

4. Security & Privacy  
   • InviteToken = random 22-char Base62 stored only in DB path (no guessable IDs)  
   • Rules: only players listed in `/lobbies/{id}/players` can read/write that lobby  
   • Rate-limit: max 10 join attempts / IP / minute with Cloud Functions if abused  
   • No secret keys in client; all env via VITE_… variables as already practiced  

────────────────────────────────────
B. Milestones & Sprints (MVP path)
────────────────────────────────────
Milestone 0 – “Foundation” (½ d)  
  - Verify Firebase project + anonymous auth enabled  
  - Set up CI lint/test & .env.example in repo

Sprint 1 – “Domain & API skeleton” (2 d)  
  1. Write Lobby context model (TypeScript interfaces only)  
  2. Implement LobbyRepository (create/read/update, unit-tested)  
  3. Draft Firebase security rules (fail-first tests with emulator)  
  4. Storybook stub components: LobbyCreate, LobbyWaitingRoom, PlayerList  

Sprint 2 – “Happy-path Lobby UX” (3 d)  
  1. Host flow  
     - “Create lobby” button → POST to repository → redirect /lobby/:id  
     - Display shareable link (copy + QR)  
  2. Guest flow  
     - Landing name prompt → join lobby with token  
     - Real-time player list (tailwind avatars)  
  3. Smoke-test on two browsers / mobile

Sprint 3 – “Hardening & Edge Cases” (2 d)  
  1. Reconnect / disconnect detection (presence)  
  2. Handle duplicate names, max player cap (configurable)  
  3. Loading / error states; toast notifications  
  4. Instrument basic analytics (join time, dropouts)

Milestone 1 – “Production-ready Lobby”  
  - All checklist items green; host can reliably gather friends.

────────────────────────────────────
C. Workflow for Each Sprint
────────────────────────────────────
1. Backlog grooming  
   • Convert outline to user stories w/ Definition of Done & acceptance tests.  
2. Kick-off  
   • Re-state sprint goal; surface risks.  
3. Daily iteration loop  
   • Code → PR → automated test & lint → peer review → merge to `dev`.  
4. End-of-day bot  
   • Post Firebase emulator test report + Lighthouse perf snapshot.  
5. Sprint review & retro  
   • Demo with 3 remote browsers; note latency & auth hiccups.

────────────────────────────────────
D. Cautionary Advice
────────────────────────────────────
• Avoid coupling “players” to auth early; anonymous UID may change on sign-out.  
• Keep LobbyRepository isolated: switching to Postgres + WebSocket later should only require adapter swap.  
• Index Firebase paths `/lobbies/*/players` on `.joinedAt` for ordering (scoreboard later).  
• Protect against “lobby enumeration” by using cryptographically random IDs, not push-IDs.  

────────────────────────────────────
E. Deliverables for Sprint 1
────────────────────────────────────
- `/docs/lobby/DOMAIN_MODEL.md` (<500 lines)  
- `/docs/lobby/SECURITY_RULES.md`  
- Lobby interfaces & repository (100% unit test coverage)  
- Security rules tested via emulator CI job  
- Storybook stubs with a11y pass

────────────────────────────────────
Next Step
────────────────────────────────────
If this structure looks good, we flesh out the Sprint 1 backlog items (stories, acceptance criteria, test outline).  Let me know what you’d like to adjust or dive into!

Plesae check these 3 items:
1. how do we tie lobby id to spotify user?
2. React + Context / Zustand for lobby state 
what is this and why is this needed

3. @Web Check Spotify API current documentation. Would this be possible with Spotify API:
* anonymous guests Add songs to a shared playlist
* see which song is currently played by the authorized user from their shared playlist
* Guess which player added each song


---

**Cursor**

Below are concise answers to the three follow-up questions, with pointers to the current Spotify Web-API docs.

────────────────────────────────────
1 How do we tie a lobby ID to a Spotify user?
────────────────────────────────────
• During “Create lobby”, the host completes a Spotify OAuth flow (`user-read-private`, `playlist-modify-public`, `playlist-modify-private`, `user-read-playback-state` scopes).  
• After Spotify redirects back, we receive the host’s `spotifyUserId` and long-lived refresh token.  
• We write one Firebase document:

```
/lobbies/{lobbyId}
  ├─ hostFirebaseUid          // UID from Firebase Auth
  ├─ hostSpotifyUserId        // e.g. "wizzbang42"
  ├─ playlistId               // created right now or later
  ├─ createdAt                // serverTimestamp
  └─ status                   // "waiting" | "in_progress" | "finished"
```

Because the document contains both `lobbyId` (public, shared in the URL) and `hostSpotifyUserId` (private), we can:
• call Spotify on behalf of the host (server-side Cloud Function that exchanges a refresh token → access token)  
• display “▶ Now playing” info to all guests by broadcasting via Realtime DB.  

Guests never touch Spotify directly; they remain anonymous (Firebase anonymous auth).

────────────────────────────────────
2 “React + Context / Zustand for lobby state” — what & why?
────────────────────────────────────
• React Context = built-in mechanism to pass data deeply without prop-drilling. Great for *who* the current lobby is and whether the user is host/guest.  
• Zustand = a tiny Flux-like state-management library. Why add it?  
  – It gives a global store with selector hooks (`useLobbyStore(state ⇒ state.players)`) without Context provider nesting.  
  – Re-renders are scoped to selected slices → better perf than one giant Context.  
  – Its API is dead simple (no reducers/boilerplate), so we keep cognitive load low.  

Typical pattern:
```ts
// src/contexts/LobbyContext.tsx
export const LobbyContext = createContext<LobbyMeta | null>(null);

// src/store/lobbyStore.ts
export const useLobbyStore = create<LobbyState>(set => ({
  players: {},
  addPlayer: p => set(s => ({ players: { ...s.players, [p.id]: p } })),
}));
```
UI components read immutable lobby metadata from Context and live player list / scores from Zustand.  
This split keeps concerns clear and prevents accidental re-creates of WebSocket/Firebase listeners.

────────────────────────────────────
3 Feasibility with current Spotify API
────────────────────────────────────
a) “Anonymous guests add songs to a shared playlist”  
 • Playlist endpoints require *someone’s* OAuth token with a `playlist-modify` scope.  
 • Therefore, truly anonymous guests can’t call Spotify. Two common work-arounds:  
   1. Guests nominate tracks by pasting URLs/URIs → server adds them via the **host’s** token.  
   2. Ask each guest to perform a lightweight PKCE login (then they’re no longer anonymous).  
 Conclusion: *Yes*, but only by proxy through the authenticated host (or by asking guests to authenticate).

b) “See which song is currently played by the authorized user”  
 • Endpoint `GET /v1/me/player/currently-playing` (`user-read-playback-state` scope) returns the current track on the host’s device.  
 • We can poll it every few seconds or use the Web Playback SDK events if playback is inside the browser.  
 • Broadcast the result to guests over Firebase.  
 Conclusion: *Yes*, fully supported.  
 Docs: [Get Currently Playing Track](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-the-users-currently-playing-track)

c) “Guess which player added each song”  
 • `Get Playlist Items` returns an `added_by` field with the Spotify user who added the track.  
 • For a *collaborative playlist* that field is populated automatically.  
 • If only the host token adds tracks on behalf of guests, `added_by` will always be the host, so we must store our own metadata:  
```
/lobbies/{id}/playlistMeta/{trackUri}
  └─ suggestedBy : playerId
```  
 Conclusion:  
  – Automatic identification works **only** if each player is authenticated and adds the track themselves.  
  – Otherwise we must persist a custom mapping.

────────────────────────────────────
TL;DR
────────────────────────────────────
1. Save the host’s Spotify user ID in the lobby document; use their refresh token to act on Spotify.  
2. React Context delivers immutable lobby meta; Zustand holds fast-changing real-time state.  
3. All three capabilities are doable, but adding & attribution for *anonymous* guests requires the server to mediate (or to ask them to log in).

```plaintext
/lobbies/{lobbyId}
  ├─ hostFirebaseUid          // UID from Firebase Auth
  ├─ hostSpotifyUserId        // e.g. "wizzbang42"
  ├─ playlistId               // created right now or later
  ├─ createdAt                // serverTimestamp
  └─ status                   // "waiting" | "in_progress" | "finished"
```

```typescript
// src/contexts/LobbyContext.tsx
export const LobbyContext = createContext<LobbyMeta | null>(null);

// src/store/lobbyStore.ts
export const useLobbyStore = create<LobbyState>(set => ({
  players: {},
  addPlayer: p => set(s => ({ players: { ...s.players, [p.id]: p } })),
}));
```

```plaintext
/lobbies/{id}/playlistMeta/{trackUri}
  └─ suggestedBy : playerId
```

1.Guests nominate tracks by pasting URLs/URIs → server adds them via the host’s token.
no, the game should have search for spotify songs

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely—guests can stay anonymous and still use an in-app “Search Spotify” dialog.  
Below is a practical flow that satisfies both Spotify’s auth model and our “no-login-for-guests” rule.

────────────────────────────────────
A. How anonymous search works
────────────────────────────────────
1  Backend obtains an “app-only” token  
   • Use the Client-Credentials flow (no user context) ⇒ access token with **no user scopes**.  
   • This token is perfect for read-only endpoints like `GET /v1/search`.  
   • Cache it in memory until it expires (60 min) to reduce traffic to Spotify’s auth server.

2  Guest types a query  
   • Front-end `debounce(400 ms)` → `POST /api/spotify/search?q=…&type=track`.  
   • Cloud Function / Express route forwards the call with the cached app token.  
   • Response includes track name, artist, album art, URI, duration, preview\_url (if any).

3  Guest picks a track  
   • Front-end emits `addTrackProposal` to Firebase at  
     `/lobbies/{id}/proposals/{trackUri}`  
     ```
     {
       proposedBy : playerId,
       track      : { uri, name, artists, duration_ms, preview_url }
     }
     ```  
   • UI immediately shows it as “pending”.

4  Host-token bot finalises the add  
   • Cloud Function `onCreate` listener on `/proposals/*`  
     – Reads the lobby’s stored `hostRefreshToken`  
     – Exchanges → host access token (scopes `playlist-modify-private|public`)  
     – `POST /v1/playlists/{playlistId}/tracks` body `{ uris:[trackUri] }`  
     – On success:  
       – Move document to `/playlistMeta/{trackUri}` with `addedBy : playerId`  
       – Delete from proposals / mark as accepted.  
     – On failure: write error field → front-end displays toast.  

Guests never touch Spotify credentials; the only privileged calls happen server-side.

────────────────────────────────────
B. UX & real-time considerations
────────────────────────────────────
• Autocomplete / preview  
  – Limit results to 10 tracks, 3 requests / sec per guest.  
  – Display 30-sec `preview_url` if available; otherwise grey out the play button (complies with Spotify TOS on previews).

• Duplicate prevention  
  – Server rejects a proposal if the track already exists in `/playlistMeta`.

• Abuse & rate limiting  
  – Search endpoint: 30 req / sec / client-id (§Spotify rate limits).  
  – Cloud Function should apply per-IP quota (> userRules: security best practice).

────────────────────────────────────
C. Sprint-level impact
────────────────────────────────────
• Add tasks to Sprint 2  
  2.1 Build `SearchDialog` component (Typeahead + list)  
  2.2 Implement `/api/spotify/search` wrapper + caching logic  
  2.3 Write Firebase rule: only authenticated (even if anonymous) users may write to `/proposals/{trackUri}`  

• Add tasks to Sprint 3  
  3.5 Cloud Function `onProposalCreated` (add to playlist, move metadata)  
  3.6 End-to-end test: two browsers, guest adds song, host playlist updates within 2 s.

────────────────────────────────────
D. Compliance checkpoints
────────────────────────────────────
✓ Client-Credentials token is stored server-side only.  
✓ All playlist mutations use the host’s user token (required by Spotify’s policy).  
✓ We display Spotify attribution and album art exactly as returned (§ Developer Terms).  
✓ No secrets leak to the browser; all env vars remain in server runtime.

This approach gives guests the full “search & pick” experience while keeping them anonymous and staying within Spotify’s current API constraints.

```plaintext
     {
       proposedBy : playerId,
       track      : { uri, name, artists, duration_ms, preview_url }
     }
```

**User**

what would be better approach?

In terms of simplicity and less possible bugs

1. Only host spotify access is used for update playlist

2. Each player logs in from their spotify account and adds to shared playlist 

---

**Cursor**

Below is a side-by-side comparison focused strictly on “overall simplicity” and “bug-surface area”.  Pick whichever flavour of complexity you prefer—there isn’t a single winner for every team.

────────────────────────────────────
OPTION A “One-token model”
Only the host authorises Spotify; everyone else stays anonymous.
────────────────────────────────────
What becomes simpler
• On-boarding Guests never see an OAuth screen → zero drop-off.  
• Token storage Exactly one refresh-token in the DB; easy to rotate or revoke.  
• Playlist ownership Playlist is always owned by the host, so ACL issues disappear.

What grows in complexity / bug risk
• Extra backend paths You must implement the “proposal → approve → add” workflow and keep it race-free.  
• False attribution Spotify’s `added_by` will always be the host.  You have to maintain custom metadata and keep it in sync if a track is later removed or reordered.  
• Rate limits All playlist writes hit a single user-token, so rapid, parallel additions can 429.

Net simplicity score
• Fewer moving parts in auth, **more** moving parts in data-flow.  
• Best when your priority is friction-free guest entry and you’re comfortable writing a small dispatcher Cloud Function.

────────────────────────────────────
OPTION B “Everyone logs in”
Each player completes PKCE OAuth and writes to the playlist directly.
────────────────────────────────────
What becomes simpler
• Business logic No proposal queue, no custom `added_by` mapping, no server-side playlist writes.  The front-end calls `POST /playlists/{id}/tracks` and you’re done.  
• Real-time accuracy Spotify already knows who added what; any later re-ordering or removal keeps attribution intact.  
• Scalability Writes are spread across many user tokens, so hitting rate limits is unlikely.

What grows in complexity / bug risk
• User experience Every guest must have (or create) a Spotify account and approve scopes—expect some churn.  
• Multi-token maintenance Tokens can expire or be revoked one by one; you need robust refresh handling for N players.  
• Edge permissions Guests must follow the playlist and have `playlist-modify-*` scope; if they skip a step the add will fail.

Net simplicity score
• More moving parts in auth, **fewer** in server logic.  
• Best when your players are comfortable logging into Spotify and you want to off-load as much as possible to Spotify’s own ACLs.

────────────────────────────────────
Decision heuristics
────────────────────────────────────
Choose A (host-only token) if:
• You want a “Jackbox-style” experience where anyone can join in two clicks.  
• Your team is happy to write a small mediation layer and accept minor attribution bookkeeping.

Choose B (everyone logs in) if:
• Your players are already Spotify users and don’t mind OAuth.  
• You prefer to remove custom backend logic and lean on Spotify to track who did what.

Either path is viable and industry-compliant; pick the one that places complexity where your team is stronger (UX vs. backend plumbing).

lets choose A

**Cursor**

Great—Approach A (“host-only Spotify token, guests remain anonymous”) is locked in.  
Below is the feature-2 delivery plan that sits on top of the lobby work we already outlined.

════════════════════════════════ Feature #2 ― Add Songs to Shared Playlist (Host-Only Token) ════════════════════════════════

A. Core Architecture Decisions
1. Search authority  
   • Server holds a *client-credentials* token (read-only) for `GET /v1/search`.  
   • Token cached in memory (≈60 min) and rotated automatically.

2. Write authority  
   • Host granted `playlist-modify` scopes during lobby creation → refresh token stored server-side (env-encrypted).  
   • Cloud Function exchanges refresh→access token whenever a guest proposal appears.

3. Data shapes  
```
/lobbies/{lobbyId}
  ├─ playlistId              // created when first track accepted
  └─ …

/lobbies/{lobbyId}/proposals/{trackUri}
  └─ { proposedBy, trackMeta, createdAt }

/lobbies/{lobbyId}/playlistMeta/{trackUri}
  └─ { addedBy, trackMeta, addedAt, snapshotId }
```

4. Security rules (Firebase)  
   • Anonymous users may *read* playlistMeta & proposals; *write* only their own proposal doc.  
   • Cloud Function runs with admin privileges; no secrets reach the client.

5. Failure / edge paths  
   • Duplicate track or 429 from Spotify ⇒ mark proposal → status:"rejected", reason.  
   • Host token revoked ⇒ lobby goes into “maintenance” banner and prompts host to re-authenticate.

B. Milestones & Sprints (adds on to previous timeline)

Milestone 2 – “Playlist Collaboration MVP”

Sprint 4 (3 d) — Guest Search & Proposal  
  4.1 SearchDialog component with debounce & preview audio  
  4.2 `/api/spotify/search` route + token-cache middleware  
  4.3 Firebase rules: guests can write proposals ≤ 5 active each  
  4.4 UX polish: duplicate warning, proposal list with avatars

Sprint 5 (2 d) — Proposal Processing & Playlist Sync  
  5.1 Cloud Function `onProposalCreated` → add track via host token  
  5.2 Create playlist on first accept; store `playlistId` & initial snapshotId  
  5.3 Move proposal → playlistMeta, broadcast toast “Track added by X”  
  5.4 E2E test: two browsers + emulator, latency < 2 s

Sprint 6 (2 d) — Hardening & Rate-Limit Guards  
  6.1 Exponential back-off + retry queue for transient Spotify 5xx  
  6.2 Batch additions if ≥ 5 pending proposals  
  6.3 Alerting: Slack webhook if > 3 failures in 5 min  
  6.4 Accessibility pass for SearchDialog (keyboard nav, screen reader)

Milestone 2 exit criteria  
  • Guest can search > select > see track appear in < 3 s.  
  • No secrets exposed in network tab.  
  • Manual chaos test: drop network, duplicate proposals, token expiry—all handled gracefully.

C. Workflow Add-ons for these sprints
• New CI job: Jest + Firebase-emulator tests for security rules on `/proposals`.  
• Mock-Spotify server for local dev to avoid rate limits.  
• Add `docs/playlist/SEARCH_API.md` and `docs/playlist/PROPOSAL_FLOW.md` (≤500 lines each, cross-linked from INDEX.md).

D. Cautionary Advice
• Remember that `preview_url` is not guaranteed; the UI must tolerate nulls.  
• Store `snapshotId` returned by each playlist mutation—handy for later rollbacks.  
• Clean up orphaned proposals on lobby end to avoid dangling writes against an expired refresh token.

E. Next Step
Convert Sprint 4 items into granular user stories with acceptance criteria and start the ticketing board.  
When you’re ready, we’ll draft those stories (no code, just wording) so the team can pick them up.

```plaintext
/lobbies/{lobbyId}
  ├─ playlistId              // created when first track accepted
  └─ …

/lobbies/{lobbyId}/proposals/{trackUri}
  └─ { proposedBy, trackMeta, createdAt }

/lobbies/{lobbyId}/playlistMeta/{trackUri}
  └─ { addedBy, trackMeta, addedAt, snapshotId }
```
